 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

Prototype 1: Inspired by "Smash Hit." 
The prototype takes the projectile element from Mission Demolition, changing it from a 2D view of being thrown from a slingshot to a 3D view of being thrown in first-person view.
The player clicks on the screen to shoot projectiles toward targets to gain points, aiming for a mix of joy, frustration, and satisfaction. Joy comes from landing difficult shots, frustration from near-misses or challenging levels, and satisfaction from beating previous high scores.
The camera view takes inspiration from Mission Demolition and Roll a Ball, where the camera is not stuck in place but dynamically moving towards a target point in the scene.
